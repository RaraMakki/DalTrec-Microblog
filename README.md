This code reads the crawled tweets from json files in ./data/tweets and index them separately for each day. Then, loads the manually assigned weights from ./data/ManuallyLabeledKeyterms2.txt. These weights indicate the importance of manually extracted keyterms in each topic/profile. Using these weights, we create boosted queries and set Lucene similarity to "LMDirichletSimilarity". The ranked tweets returned by Lucene are tested to see whether they have enough evidence/keyterms that they belong to the topic in the query, i.e. if the sum of the weights of the keyterms appeared in the tweet pass a predefined threshold. If yes, then the tweet is returned as relevant. Otherwise, it is ignored.
